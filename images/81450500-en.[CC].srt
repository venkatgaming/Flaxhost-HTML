Yep.

10
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,811
Do you have a theory?

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,480
I do. [exhales]

12
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,731
It's bullshit.

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,233
Bullshit?

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,651
It never happened.

15
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,405
How can that be? The world saw it happen.

16
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,449
Sure, everyone on Earth.
But you know who <i>didn't </i>see it?

Webb, Hubble, CHEOPS.

18
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,581
None of the satellites saw it.
You know why?

19
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,709
-Why?
-Because it never happened.

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,127
It was a deepfake.

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,046
Interesting theory.

22
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,215

It comes from a question that Enrico Fermi
asked his colleagues at Los Alamos.

There are a hundred billion
stars in our galaxy.

104
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,104
Many of these stars
must have planets similar to our own.

105
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,609
And many of these planets
must have developed intelligent life.

106
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,863
So where is everybody?

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,035
Maybe there's no one out there.

108
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,996
Our signal is too weak.

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,707

116
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,900

131
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,298
[in Mandarin] On June 12th last year,
Dr. Peterson's team in California

132
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,968
observed strong bursts

133
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,598

On the same day,
we detected an intense radio burst.

136
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,609
So we detected the same thing as America?

137
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:32,947
No. Our recordings picked up the burst
13 minutes after Mt. Wilson.

138
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,285
And not from Jupiter.

139
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,495
From the Sun.

140
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:44,667
SUN

141
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,719
From Jupiter to the Earth,
it took 38 minutes.

142
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,474
From Jupiter to the Sun,
it took 43 minutes.

143
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,518
From the Sun to the Earth,

144
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,978
8 minutes.

145
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:18,034
43 plus 8 equals 51.
A difference of 13 minutes.

146
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,790
I simplified the math for you.

147
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,087
The Sun reflected
the radio waves from Jupiter?

148
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,757
Not just reflected. It <i>amplified </i>them.

149
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:37,595
The signal from the Sun was millions of
times stronger than the one from Jupiter.

150
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,891
So we can use the Sun as a super-antenna?

151
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,644
By aiming our signal at the Sun?

152
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,728
Exactly.

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,007
Yes. We should.

160
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,480
This is a radical idea, Comrade Yang.

161
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,442
Yes.
I've been working on it for some time.

162
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,779
It could take many years
to get a response, but…

163
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,780
Enter.

164
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,244
I want her to verify your work.

165
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:51,878
Comrade Yang has devised a way to use
the Sun to amplify our transmission.

166
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,966
His numbers are compelling.

167
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,305
You believe his calculations
to be correct?

168
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,894
[quietly] They are correct.

169
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,565
[Lei Zhicheng] You want to aim
a super-powerful radio beam at the Sun.

170
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,150
At the Red Sun?

171
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,028
Have you thought about the
political symbolism of such an experiment?

172
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,404
[Yang Weining] Well. Commissar, I…

173
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:23,493
[Lei Zhicheng] Who is the Red Sun
in the heart of the People?

174
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,163
This is very disappointing from you,
Comrade Yang.

175
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,165
And I would think, Comrade Ye Wenjie,

176
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,167
that as the daughter of a class enemy

177
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,835
you would have warned him

178
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,462
how dangerous his ideas were.

179
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,340
[Yang Weining] Sir.
Imagine our great Red Sun, our Chairman,

amplifying the words of the People,
a hundred millionfold.

181
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,095
Absolutely not. I forbid it.

182
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,681
This could get us all executed.

[in English] What do you know
about this man?

213
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,044
[Auggie] He was at Vera's funeral.

214
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,587
Mike Evans.

215
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,550
Owns Evans Energy, the biggest
privately held oil company on the planet.

216
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,720
Now, does it surprise you
that Vera had a friend like that?

217
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,806
Nothing surprises me anymore.

218
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,101
You know what surprises me?

219
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,525
This woman you say you spoke to.

220
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,945
Here's security footage
of the alley you were in.

221
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,530
There you are.

222
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,407
All alone,

223
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,701
talking to no one.

224
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,828
No. No, she was there.

225
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,414
-Doesn't look like it, does it?
-I swear to God she was there.

226
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,790
I wasn't talking to myself.

227
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,876
I believe you. Look.

228
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,507
Your cigarette's unlit, and…

229
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,554
Your cigarette's lit.

230
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,765
You didn't light it yourself.
Your lighter doesn't work.

231
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,313
Now, I don't know how, but someone
scrubbed her out of the footage.

232
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,274
My team couldn't find
any trace of it being manipulated

233
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,236
but we know it was,
which is fucking… pretty weird.

234
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,116
Not as weird as the stars
turning on and off, but weird.

235
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,328
Why did they wanna shut down your lab?

236
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,079
I don't know.

237
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,332
Well, you must be someone important.

238
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,291
I'm not important.

239
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,960
Well, you just invented
the world's finest nanofiber,

240
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,338
3,000 times finer than human hair,

241
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,382
invisible as air,
as strong as steel, all that shit.

242
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,675
All that shit.

243
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,887
Well, it's obviously dangerous to someone.

244
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,222
Competitor, maybe.

245
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,183
Yeah, a competitor
who made the universe flicker.

246
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,354
Were you close to Vera Ye?

247
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,275
I used to be.

248
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,111
Smartest person I've ever met.

249
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,031
Then I think I disappointed her

250
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,700
'cause I quit her course
and switched into applied science.

251
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,787
Maybe that's why she killed herself.

00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,582
This countdown you saw,

253
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,504
it disappeared as soon as
you stopped your work, right?

254
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,965
Has anyone else seen it?

255
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,924
They have.

A physicist in London just the other day.

259
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,308
Couple of dozen more.

260
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,769
What happened to them?

261
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,981
They quit working.

[unsettling music plays softly]

or they quit like Vera Ye.

Oh wow.

[chuckles] Sorry. I just didn't know
you were, um…

Or no?

291
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,593
So, a character in the game, then.

00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,720
[Count] Enough talk of games!
This is no game.

293

This is my follower.

294
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,476
You may call her Follower.

[Jin] I'm Jin Cheng.

296
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,231
Please, choose a better name.

Uh-huh.

Your mission is to solve
the riddle of this world.

[Jin] Riddle of this world?

302
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,453
All right. How about, uh…

303
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,581
Copernicus.

304
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,088
Welcome to Civilization 137, Copernicus.

Hey…

[sighs]

307
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,302
Where are we going?

308
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,264
We're going to the pyramid
to see Emperor Zhou.

309
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,266
This is a chaotic era.

310
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,350
[Jin] A chaotic era?

311
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,563
[Count] Except for stable eras,
all times are chaotic eras.

312
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,648
When a new era arrives,

313
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,318
the Emperor consults great minds
about the movements of the sun.

314
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,988
This is a weird fucking game.

315
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,659
You must decide
whether an era is chaotic or stable.

316
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,748
If Emperor Zhou is wrong,
an entire civilization will be destroyed.

317
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,458
What? How?

318
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,671
[Count] Like this.

[Jin] Hey, don't push her.

There's only enough shade for two of us.

327
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,619
Count.

328
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,747
[Count] Well, it can't be me.
I must get my prediction to the Emperor.

329
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,041
-You won't abandon me, will you?
-Go.

330
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,549
[Jin] It's too hot. She's gonna burn up.

331
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,259
[Count] No, she won't.

335
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,014
Is she dead?

336
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:29,932
[Count] No.

337
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,604
Those who dehydrate fast enough
can be preserved.

338
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,566
We rehydrate them
when a stable era arrives.

339
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,945
So, this is how people
survive the chaotic eras?

340
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,699
If one of us survives, we all survive.

00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,081
What do I do with her?

344
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,583
Count!

[Jin sighs]

347
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,734
[woman 1] Well, if science can't explain
the blinking stars, why can't it be God?

348
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,360
Why would He be so subtle about it?

349
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,280
In the Bible, He sent down
angels of death with flaming swords.

350
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,325
He sent she-bears to maul children
who fucked with His prophets.

351
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,328
Now He's blinking stars
to show some kind of stupid code?

352
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,413
-What? Does that sound like God to you?
-[laughter]

353
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,123
[woman 2] Who else can make stars flicker?

354
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,584
-[Saul] No one can do that.
-[woman 1] So, how did it happen?

355
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,501
[Saul] I don't know.

356
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,130
But if science tells you that something's
impossible, and it happens anyway,

357
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,506
it means one of two things.

358
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,424
[chuckles softly]

359
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,259

00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:37,534
After ten years you finally asked Jin out,
now that she's dating an admiral.

539
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,578
I have pancreatic cancer.

540
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,289
Stage four.

541
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,002
It's spread all over.

542
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,088
Liver, lungs.

543
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,843
Median survival time is, uh…

544
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,555
It's, like, two to six months, so…

545
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,642
There it is.

546
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,352
[quietly] Fuck that.

547
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,229
What?

548
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,899
Some NHS doctor says so,
and you're just gonna accept it?

549
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:10,900
No.

550
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,403
No, no, no. No, no. Fuck that.

551
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,488
We'll… We'll go to Switzerland.

552
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,409
-Or New York, or somewhere fucking good.
-No, Jack. I'm too far gone, mate.

553
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,538
All they can do now is
to make me comfortable. All right?

554
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,874
So they're gonna operate
on my tumors, that's…

555
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,711
They're gonna… fluff the pillows
on the sinking ship.

556
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,212
And I said,

557
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,882
"Fuck that, pal."

558
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,969
-My money says they're wrong.
-Come on, Jack.

559
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,596
You fucking come on.

560
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,851
This is what you always do, man.
You-- You give up on everything--

561
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,019
I didn't give up--

562
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,313
You quit physics,
thought you weren't smart enough.

563
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,107
You gave up on Jin because
you thought you were punching above.

564
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:57,030
You're not giving up
on your own fucking life. [sniffles]

565
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,660
Fuck that.

566
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,625
Eat.

567
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,751
[sighs]

568
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,005
-I don't feel like eating, Jack.
-Will. Just…

569
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,009
Try.

570
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,852
[tense music playing]

571
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,944
[ominous orchestral music playing]

572
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,727
[Count] If I may, Emperor Zhou,
the sun is Yang.

573
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,813
The night is Yin.

574
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,193
Presently we are caught
in the chaos of imbalance.

575
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,530
But we shall be no longer.

576
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,907
I bring you salvation
for our civilization--

577
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,743
[Zhou] Yes. Yes, get on with it.

578
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,079
I have created a code for the universe.

579
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,458
And with this code,
I can predict the movements of the sun.

580
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,752
That's what they all say.

581
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,968
[tense, rhythmic music playing]

582
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,685
I hope your prediction can save us,
for your sake.

583
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,271
-This is prophecy, not prediction.
-[Zhou] What?

584
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,691
Speak aloud, child, or die.

585
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,692
[clears throat]

586
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,783
Emperor. This is the <i>I Ching.</i>

587
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,952
It's beautiful, but it's not scientific.

588
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:08,912
Explain.

589
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,789
[Jin] I don't think
it will solve your problem.

590
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,583
It's divination.
It doesn't follow any physical laws.

591
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,586
Physical laws?

592
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,546
Yeah. The laws of physics.

593
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,134
Everything we've observed
to be true about the world.

594
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,179
Which world?

595
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,681
[Count] Your Imperial Majesty.

596
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,646
The code is complete.
It will answer your questions.

597
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,605
[Zhou] Very well.

598
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,983
When will it be safe
to rehydrate the masses?

599
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,197
[sizzling]

600
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,087
The chaotic era
will last another eight days.

601
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,801
And when it is over, we will enjoy
a glorious stable era for 63 years

602
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,138
with a climate so mild,
it will be a golden age.

603
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,849
Sky. Now.

604
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,647
Let the days fly past.

605
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,237
Let the days fly past.

606
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,530
[Jin] Hmm?

607
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,783
Put your hand on the ground.
It speeds up time.

608
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,830
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

609
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,873
[Jin gasps]

610
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,061
There!

611
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,647
Stability for 63 years.

612
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,191
-Is it possible?
-It is, Emperor.

613
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,196
I advise you to awaken your dynasty
and let it prosper.

614
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,534
Rehydrate!

615
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,030
[bright instrumental music playing]

616
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,647
[group exclaims]

617
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,032
[laughing]

618
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,044
[Jin inhales sharply]

619
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,301
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

620
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,096
[Follower gasps]

621
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,180
[exhales]

622
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,855
You didn't abandon me.

623
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,231
Of course not.

624
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,034
[wind picks up]

625
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,871
[Jin gasps]

626
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,582
Count! Look!

627
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,418
[Zhou] No.

628
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,922
[ominous string music playing]

629
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,260
[wind gusting]

630
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,147
[all screaming]

631
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,652
[Follower] Copernicus!

632
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,863
Copernicus, please!

633
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,490
[wind whistling]

634
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,617
[crowd clamoring]

635
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,118
[Follower] Save me!

636
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,000
-[gasps]
-[Follower] Copernicus, please!

637
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,668
[Jin groans]

638
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,131
[Follower] Please, Copernicus!

639
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,592
[Jin grunting]

640
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,012
[Follower] Copernicus!

641
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,473
[people shouting]

642
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,475
[Follower] Save me!

643
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,938
Please!

644
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,941
Save me!

645
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,654
-[Jin grunts]
-[icy shards splintering]

646
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,666
[frigid wind whipping]

647
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,751
[Jin breathing shakily]

648
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,468
[wind dies down]

649
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,315
[Jin sighs]

650
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,153
[somber instrumental music playing]

651
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,580
Civilization number 137
was obliterated by extreme cold.

652
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,332
You did not save them.

653
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,004
But you did establish the superiority
of science over mysticism.

654
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:38,217
In level two, you must use science
to save the next civilization.

655
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,637
[Jin gasps]

656
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,807
[stirring orchestral music playing]

657
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,787
[music fades slowly]

658
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,625
-[birds calling]
-[horn honking in distance]

659
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,553
[door opens]

660
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,198
I received a complaint about you,
Clarence.

661
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,699
What did I do now?

662
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,826
Apparently you've been smoking
in your office.

663
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,956
Yeah, I'd go outside, but it's a long way.

664
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,293
I'll go outside next time.

665
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,255
No need. I sacked the guy
who made the complaint.

666
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,092
If he's worrying about you,
he's not worrying about our adversaries.

667
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,843
Well, I wish you hadn't fired him.

668
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,762
Tell me about Evans.

669
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,223
[Clarence sighs]

670
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,101
Turns out he likes paying for things.

671
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,063
Anti-vax propaganda,
5G conspiracy theories,

672
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,774
anti-science politicians around the world.

673
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,361
I'd bet money
he's behind all the rest of it too.

674
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,531
What about the stars?
Did he pay for them to disappear?

675
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,617
There's someone behind everything.
You just have to dig.

676
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,662
Well, I dug up this.

677
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,084
I was reading up on radio telescopes
after the stars blinked.

678
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:41,173
Back in 1977, Ohio State University
detected a 72-second sequence.

679
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,093
They called it the Wow! signal

680
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,763
because it made
all the astrophysicists go, "Wow!"

681
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,641
They said it looked like
an attempt at communication.

682
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,101
Attempt from who?

683
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,270
Little green men.

684
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,772
What's it say?

685
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,065
No one knows.

686
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,192
No one's been able to decode it,

687
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,154
and nobody outside of Ohio State
detected it.

688
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:09,327
Except for one observatory
in Northeast China.

689
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:11,954
And?

690
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,041
Well, it's probably nothing.

691
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,208
[sniffles]

692
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,210
[sighs]

693
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,797
Funny thing about Mike Evans.

694
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,969
Guess where he lived in 1977?

695
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,972
[birds singing]

696
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,058
[gentle orchestral music playing]

697
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,657
[man, in Mandarin] No coffee,

698
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,742
sorry.

699
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,828
No coffee,

700
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,913
many years.

701
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,712
[in English] May I ask why you are here?

702
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,426
I'm trying to save lives.

703
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,635
The locals?

704
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,846
-[scoffs]
-[Ye Wenjie] How are you helping--

705
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,098
You hear "lives,"
and you think human lives.

706
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,559
Of course,
we always think of ourselves first.

707
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:05,234
I'm trying to save a bird, a subspecies
of the northwestern brown swallow.

708
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,904
I doubt I'll succeed. The loggers,
they work faster than one person can.

709
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,323
You planted all those trees yourself?

710
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,825
Mm-hmm.

711
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,204
How long will you stay here?

712
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,748
My whole life if I have to.

713
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,171
How many people
get the chance to save a species?

714
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,509
Ten thousand species go extinct
every year because of the greed of one.

715
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,473
May I ask why <i>you </i>are here?

716
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:41,395
We are looking for a site
to build a radio astronomy laboratory.

717
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,313
Here?

718
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,941
-This land isn't yours.
-It shouldn't belong to anyone.

719
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,443
It belongs to the People.

720
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,320
And the People will destroy it.

721
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,490
Ruin an entire ecosystem for a radio lab.

722
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,408
It doesn't trouble you?

723
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,204
The stupidity of the People?

724
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,209
It isn't up to me.

725
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,134
I have work to do.

726
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,678
[in Mandarin] What did he say?

727
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,305
He understands.

728
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,557
[in English] Yes, I understand. Please go.

729
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,532
[tense music playing]

730
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:40,412
[in English] "In nature,
nothing exists alone."

731
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,680
What's your name?

732
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,764
Ye Wenjie.

733
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,475
Mike Evans.

734
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,107
-I will try to stop them.
-[Evans sighs]

735
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,576
[in Mandarin] Ye Wenjie,
we have discussed it,

736
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,660
Commissar Lei and I…

737
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,329
Site 1 fits all the parameters.

738
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,455
Minimal electromagnetic interference, 

739
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,498
access to good roads for construction--

740
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,166
That's true of Site 2 as well.

741
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,043
The villagers at Site 2--

742
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,878
Are desperate for work.

743
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,505
Too desperate.

744
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,800
They'll see the lab
as a piece of meat to take bites from.

745
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:39,013
Commissar Lei and I have decided,
together, that Site 2 is better.

746
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,598
[Ye Wenjie sighs]

747
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,100
I know you're disappointed.

748
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,856
You're sure it's not because
you're trying to help the American?

749
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,861
You've been doing good work
for eight years. Don't throw it away.

750
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,158
There is something I can do for you.

751
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,120
The Commissar gave me
the names and records

752
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,414
of the new arrivals
at the work camp in Qiqihar.

753
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,916
In case there's anyone
who could be useful for us.

754
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:13,130
No scientists, unfortunately.
But there's a woman called Tang Hongjing.

755
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,633
She used to be a Red Guard.

756
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:19,845
During a struggle session
at Tsinghua University in 1966,

757
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,848
she dealt a fatal blow to a professor

758
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,310
called Ye Zhetai.

759
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,500
[official speaking Mandarin]

760
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:20,406
This is a new era. The past is finished.

761
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,200
The past is not finished.

762
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,911
You want me to repent?

763
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,996
You don't think you should?

764
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,457
Then who will repent for me?

765
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,502
Who will atone for what I have lost?

766
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:38,298
The Party sent me to Shaanxi
to work the wheat fields.

767
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,175
After a day's work,

768
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,720
I didn't even have the energy
to wash my clothes.

769
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:47,307
We slept on the ground at night.
Listening to the sound of wolves.

770
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:52,438
My arm was infected with gangrene.

771
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,274
The guards pinned me down…

772
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,446
and cut it off me.

773
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,826
[crying softly]

774
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,704
I was just a kid.

775
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:15,127
I was just a kid when I watched you

776
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,967
break my father's skull with a belt.

777
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,889
They told me you're clever.

778
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,516
And you should be.

779
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,603
Daughter of an academic.

780
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,022
I was not clever.

781
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:38,275
I had no utility.

782
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,278
Your mind spared you.

783
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,449
Otherwise you would have ended up
the same as me.

784
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:51,246
My father's mind did not spare him.

785
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,208
Even now

786
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,464
I would scythe him like wheat.

787
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,887
You will not repent?

788
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,522
No one repents.

789
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,607
[somber orchestral music playing]

790
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,071
[static pulsating]

791
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,883
[static warbling]

792
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,931
[buzzing]

793
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,683
[tense music playing]

794
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,579
Signal coherence rating: AAAAA

795
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,207
Do not answer. Do not answer.
Do not answer.

796
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:07,925
I am a pacifist in this world.

797
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:12,387
You are lucky that I am
the first to receive your message.

798
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:18,101
I am warning you: do not answer.

799
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,396
If you respond, we will come.

800
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,525
Your world will be conquered.

801
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,861
[Ye Wenjie breathing shakily]

802
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,782
Do not answer.

803
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,091
[tense music builds slowly]

804
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,931
[wind gusting]

805
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,769
[resolute string music playing]

806
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,437
[Ye Wenjie exhales]

807
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,986
[console whirring]

808
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,668
[satellite dish groaning]

809
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,189
[buttons clacking rapidly]

810
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,321
[string music building]

811
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,1000
[music dies down]

812
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,921
Come. We cannot save ourselves.

813
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:15,010
I will help you conquer this world.

814
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,095
[Ye Wenjie breathing shakily]

815
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,946
[music fades out]

816
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,580
[ominous closing theme playing]

817
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,698
[closing theme fades]
